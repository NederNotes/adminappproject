# adminappproject

Nothing can be said much about this project.
This is a pet project I'm working. 
This is a spring-boot implementation of a rest admin api project to seperate the back-end functionality of the admin app.
This is also to test scalibility of the proposed architecture.

The term admin is use with the knowledge that this app will and only sole purpose is to add admin capabilities to lessen webapp
creation load by implementing a modular admin api functions.
